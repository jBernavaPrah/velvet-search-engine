## Technologies used
- Use Laravel framework
- Use Mysql, with Full-Text Search Indexes

## Pattern/Principe used
- MVC (Laravel framework).
- SOLID Principe (App\Http\Controllers\IndexController, \App\Http\Requests\SearchIndexRequest, \App\JBE\Repositories\SearchRepository::execute).
- Repository Pattern (Without the Persistence Layer, Used ORM instead).
- YAGNI Principe ("You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It").
- KISS Principe ("Keep It Simple, Stupid").

## Uses only the Best Practice
- Schema Migrations.
- TTD Development (Most of the time..).
- Dependence Management with Composer.
- Webpack build with Laravel Mix.
- Use of Dependency injection thanks of Laravel container.
- Use of ORM Models with use of "Query Scope".
- Use of Traits to reuse same code in more places.
- Use of Repository with Interfaces to reuse business logic.

## Install
To use this in production run:
```
git clone linktogithubrepo.com/ projectName
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env # then modify it accordly
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed # Create database and populate it
```

## Tests
All tests are located in the `\tests` directory.  

>For testing propose you will need a mysql server because the Full-Text Search are implemented using a Mysql Drivers.

To not use the production database during test, change the `DB_DATABASE` in `\phpunit.xml`.
